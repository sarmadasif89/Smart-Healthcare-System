# How to run the code
Since it is dynamic web based system, it requires to be hosted on a server. I used localhost to host the system. For localhost, I am using WAMP Server.

Follow the steps below to configure and run the code.
1.	Create a new directory under 'wamp/www' and paste all the files from the root.
2.	Start WAMP server services.
3.	Wait for the WAMP server to change the icon color to green.
4.	Open your browser, preferably Chrome.
5.	Enter in the url: 127.0.0.1 or localhost. A localhost page will show up.
6.	Either choose PHPMyAdmin manually or enter url: 127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin
7.	You will be directed to a database manager, PhpMyAdmin. It is used for creating and managing databases. 
8.	Click ‘New’ and enter ‘capstone’ in the Create database field. Hit Create. 
9.	A new database must have been created and listed on the left. Click/Select it.
10.	On the right section of the manager, click on the tab Import.

12.	You have successfully completed the setup.
